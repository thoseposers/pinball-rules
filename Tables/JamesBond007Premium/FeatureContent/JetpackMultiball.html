        <p>Left eject shots advance Jetpack Multiball. </p>
        <p>Begin Jetpack Multiball by shooting the left ramp once fully lit. The amount of eject and ramp shots required increases for subsequent Jetpack Multiballs.</p>
        <p>When the multiball begins, shoot the center lane to lock in a jackpot value. This value decreases over time while not locked. Smart Missiles may be used to complete this shot.</p>
        <p>After enough jackpot shots are hit, shoot the left ramp for a double jackpot. Shoot the <span class="FeatureLink DragonTankTarget" onclick="LoadFeatureToBottomSheet('DragonTankTarget');">Dragon Tank Target</span> while the Bond figure passes over it, causing the ball to land on the target above, which activates the Super Jackpot and awards and Add-A-Ball.</p>
        <p>Jackpots re-light and this can process can be repeated but this time with the Bond figure being controlled by the flippers.</p>
