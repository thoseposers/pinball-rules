# Interactive Pinball Rules System (IPRS)

The Interactive Pinball Rules System is intended to make the process of learning individual pinball table features and rulesets easier. Just click on any inserts, ramps, or targets to see what they do.

## Features

- Clickable Inserts, Ramps, Targets
- Modes and Multiballs viewable from the menu
- Color coding to show the features that tie in to one another
- Simple clickable feature links in descriptions to easily navigate between features
- Mobile and desktop friendly so you can refresh your knowledge anywhere


## Contributing

With so many pinball tables available, it's impossible for one person to cover them all, so every contribution is greatly appreciated.

A template folder has been added as a beginning point for new tables. Step by step directions to use this to create a finished IPRS page will be added to the wiki in the future.
